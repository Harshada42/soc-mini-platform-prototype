# soc-mini-platform-prototype
SOC Mini Platform (Front-End Prototype) — Built a SOC/SIEM-style dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize synthetic security logs, apply search/filtering, and generate mock alerts from simple detection rules (with severity + MITRE tags). Front-end only, created for experimentation and learning.
